# EncryptionTool
This project focuses on developing a basic encryption/decryption tool that is able to implement a simple cipher on text files. Learning objectives for this project are to understand file input/output streams, file manipulation, and building basic projects in C++. Additional features may be added to the tool at later stages, but there are no planned features to be added at the moment.
